# -100days-of-code
starting #30DaysOfCode today  could extend to #100DaysOfCode  lets see how it goes. i am currently taking a UDACITY course on Advanced android development  and i also want to learn web application development. 
my targets are to  
1.finish the udacity course 
2. to get started on django framework 
3.  get basic JS and node.js knowledge  i
really cant say how this journey would  go but i am optimistic i would come out on top.
i'm not so good with Git hopefully this would help me get really up to speed.
so i up to create consecutive tags for each day
